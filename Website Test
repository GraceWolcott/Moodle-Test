<p>Grief and loss are related, making it difficult sometimes to separate the two terms and
    experiences, which is why
    they are frequently discussed together. Grief is the natural response to loss. And loss, when
    speaking of relationships, is often defined as the feeling of grief when
    separated from someone.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Over the past few years, every person has been impacted by grief and loss due to the Covid-19 pandemic,
    no matter how resilient.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Below are a few examples of how children, parents and families, and childcare providers have been impacted
    (please note there may be some overlap between groups).
</p>
<br><br>
<p>In addition, we know in the United States that at least 204,000 children, or in other words, 1 in 360 children
    in the US, have lost a parent or primary caregiver because of the Covid-19 pandemic. To reference the previous module,
    National Center for Pyramid Model Innovations has created an excellent 2-page guide for navigating when parents and
    families share hard things.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The following is a short video from the New York Times that outlines the collective grief they call ambiguous grief.
    Ambiguous grief is loss without closure.
